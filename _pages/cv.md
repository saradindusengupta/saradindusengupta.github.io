## Experiences

* [**Nunam**](https://nunam.com), India `[Aug, 2019 - Present]`
  * Machine Learning Engineer
  * Responsible for designing and developing real-time learning based systems depending on business use-cases with a relatively small team.
    * Developed an end-to-end image-based text detection and identification system for product identification and segregation in an assembly line from product label images using region-based stroke width transformation.
    * Designed and build the initial product classification algorithm for identifying its second use cases where each item was classified and graded based on a certain number of parameters. Build a Li-ion battery forecasting system to estimate remaining useful life (RUL) and state of health (SoH).
    * Implemented data pre-processing pipelines to augment effective data quality and integrity checks; database and data-flow schema design; setting up back-end services for exposing machine learning models over REST APIs and implemented model governance and monitoring framework to implement platform-wide MLOps practices.

* [**Medical Image Processing and Signal Processing Lab**](https://www.iiitmk.ac.in/MedImagCompLab/), **Indian Institute of Information Technology &
Management Kerala** `[Sept, 2018 - Feb, 2019]`
  * Research
  * Worked on context-based image enhancement and adaptive image segmentation for brain MR images to identify Region of Interest i.e. locating tumour, lesion and other abnormalities which can reduce the total time needed for partial analysis. Adapted already proposed super-resolution method by conveying path-based convolutional encoder-decoder with VGG (GAN-CPCE) and GAN constrained by the identical, residual, and cycle learning ensemble (GAN-CIRCLE) for image enhancement and building two fully convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on SegNet and U-Net for segmentation.
* [**Cleantech Solar Energy Corporation Pvt Ltd**](https://cleantechsolar.com/), Singapore  `[Jan,2018 - July,2018]`
  * Data Analyst Intern
  * Worked on smart grid assistance system for solar-powered rooftop system to forecast possible power generation and also determine overall cost based on geographical location. This project was part of my final semester project work and the detailed study can be found back [*Report*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dX2UBGimiDTbefbcfQGiKiQZ18heHPII/view?usp=sharing) and [*Github*](https://github.com/saradindusengupta/Solar-Power-Forecasting).
  * **Supervisor**: [Dr Asharaf S](https://www.iiitmk.ac.in/faculty/dr-asharaf-s/)

* [**Medical Image Processing and Signal Processing Lab**](https://www.iiitmk.ac.in/MedImagCompLab/), **Indian Institute of Information Technology & Management, Kerala** `[Jan 2017 - Aug 2017]`
  * Research Intern
  * Analysis of Regularization methods employed in k-space based image reconstruction methods such as GRAPPA & SPIRiT in parallel-MRI to determine optimal parameter selection method. Worked on k-space based image reconstruction algorithms and various regularization methods to better analyze the effect of regularization parameter on the noise level.

  * **Supervisor**: [Dr. Joseph S Paul](https://www.iiitmk.ac.in/faculty/dr-joseph-suresh-paul/)

* [**Classif.ai**](http://classif.ai/), Remote `[Jan,2017 - June,2017]`
  * Data Analyst
  * Developed data collection and data ingestion pipeline where open-sourced, web-scrapped data sets were to be cleaned, checked for data quality and bench-marked.
